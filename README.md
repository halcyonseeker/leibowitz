Leibowitz
=========

Leibowitz is an experimental Common Lisp library intended to abstract
traditional file systems to make them behave like object storage.
Features include:

* **Tagging**, so you can organize data into mutually inclusive
  ontologies.  You can also construct hierarchies of tags using the
  predicate system where data with a certain tag might be
  automatically be added to a "parent" tag.
* **Full text search** of all files.  There's room to add custom
  indexing methods to do things like OCR image files and import
  metadata for movies, books, and music and such.
* **Collections** of files that allow you to customize how Leibowitz
  sees certain files on disk grouped by directory or URL schema.  This
  allows Leibowitz to act as a manager for bookmarked webpages,
  torrents, and whatnot.
* **Modular backends** in which to store the tag ontology and text
  dump for search.  Right now only SQLite is supported.

At present Leibowitz is very much a work in progress and is varying
degrees of useful from a REPL, the command line, and a web UI. I
intend on also building several other user interface options,
including a JSON HTTP API, a 9p API, and a desktop application using
TK or maybe QT.

Installation
------------

Right now in order to build or use Leibowitz you need ffmpeg,
imagemagick, sqlite, make, quicklisp, and sbcl.  On my machine I can
build it as an executable with `make` or hack on it from a REPL with
`(load #P"leibowitz.asd"` and `(ql:quickload :leibowitz)`.  I'd like
Leibowitz to be easy to build, install, and use for people who don't
know Common Lisp, but it's still a fair long ways off from that goal.

Roadmap to 0.1 version; minimum viable product
----------------------------------------------

### Core

- [ ] Fix predicate/predicand bug where tags are being automatically
      applied where they shouldn't be.  This *might* be a usage error
      in web, which itself would indicate that my API is probably too
      unintuitive and in need of revision.
- [ ] Improve full text search to index different fields (path, title,
      body, tags, tag descriptions) separately so that the user may
      selectively search in them.
- [ ] Optimize the indexer method and make it run multiple workers in
      parallel, right now it's very slow.
- [ ] Sometimes doing a full-text search yields an error `Code
      CORRUPT: database disk image is malformed.` with the offending
      stanza being `select data.* from search left join data on
      data.id = search.id where search match ? order by rank`.
      Connecting to the database and running `pragma integrity_check`
      yields okay.  Some light stackoverflowing indicated this might
      be a result damaged indexes, which would make sense considering
      it only (so far) shows up when doing full-text search.

### Web

- [ ] Add more error handling to the web UI!  Right now it is insanely
      easy to get this thing to crash.
- [ ] Expose the full API functionality in the web frontend:
  - [ ] Editing data entries:
    - [X] Adding tags
    - [X] Removing tags
    - [ ] Moving/renaming
    - [ ] Uploading/importing from URL
    - [ ] Manually reindexing files and directories
    - [ ] Deleting
  - [ ] Editing tag entries:
    - [ ] Adding data
    - [ ] Removing data
    - [ ] Renaming tags
    - [ ] Editing tag description
    - [X] Adding parents
    - [X] Removing parents
    - [ ] Adding children
    - [ ] Removing children
  - [ ] Search and listing:
    - [ ] Support changing the sort order and criterion for all data
          listings
    - [ ] Support filtering by tag for all data listings
    - [ ] Advanced search options, requires change to core full-text
          search schema.

### CLI

- [X] The cli needs a way to normalize paths before passing them to
      the library; CL is absolutely clueless when it comes to
      resolving unix path notation.
- [ ] Expose the full API functionality in the CLI interface:
  - [ ] Editing data entries:
    - [X] Adding tags
    - [ ] Removing tags
    - [ ] Moving/renaming
    - [ ] Uploading/importing from URL
    - [ ] Manually reindexing files and directories
    - [ ] Deleting
    - [ ] Editing metadata
    - [ ] Viewing data summaries
  - [ ] Editing tag entries:
    - [X] Adding data
    - [ ] Removing data
    - [ ] Renaming tags
    - [ ] Editing tag description
    - [ ] Adding parents
    - [ ] Removing parents
    - [ ] Adding children
    - [ ] Removing children
    - [X] Viewing tag summaries
  - [ ] Search and listing:
    - [ ] Support changing the sort order and criterion for all data
          listings
    - [ ] Support filtering by tag for all data listings
    - [ ] Advanced search options, requires change to core full-text
          search schema.

Future Work
-----------
- Implement collections for gallery-dl, man, etc.
- Add support for file and collection specific metadata fields,
  probably implemented as a special kind of tags.
- Add a native GUI.
- Add full support for saving URLs, including saving magnets and
  archiving HTTP docs.  These files should have special options in all
  frontends.
- Integrate with the [Internet Archive's
  API](https://archive.org/developers/index-apis.html) to view
  historical snapshots of webpages the user has saved onto their
  computer, either as a monolithic html file, a full site archive via,
  eg, `wget -np -rkEpD example.com example.com/somewhere`, or a
  .webloc or .url file.  Could also integrate with web archive
  collections like gallery-dl to link to historical versions of the
  archived document, though that's less useful I think.
- Automatically figure out the semantic similarities of tags and data.
  - Tag similarities could potentially be computed by some combination
    of:
    - Good old Levenshtein distance to catch alternate spellings.
    - Linguistic analysis, probably provided by a full-text search
      engine.  I believe Xapian exposes some of these APIs.
    - Statistical analysis of tags' data, a set of tags are probably
      pretty similar if they share a majority of data
    - Sibling tags in the hierarchy could be found by looking for tags
      whose ancestor hierarchy is similar; ie statistical analysis of
      subgraphs of the overall DAG.
  - For data similarities the best general approach would probably be
    to store vector embeddings of each datum and find the nearest
    neighbors of each, probably using the [Hierarchical Navigable
    Small World algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320).  This
    could also be applied to find semantically similar tags.
  - For audio and image data we could probably use the same sorts of
    algorithms used by the likes of Shazam and Yandex's reverse image
    search to get semantic structure from non-textual data â€” I need to
    read up on this more.
- Could be interesting to supplement search with a local LLM, probably
  Facebook's [Llama2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/), fed entirely by
  your local corpus.

Notes
-----
* Good UI: <https://github.com/philomena-dev/philomena> for example in
  <https://derpibooru.org/>.  Leibowitz could integrate with a tagged
  forum like Tumblr or Dreamwidth/Livejournal where each datum is a
  post with replies/comments and tags...
